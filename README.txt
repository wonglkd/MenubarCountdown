This is a fork of Menubar Countdown.  It's meant to be an incredibly minimal menu bar timer useful for me; if you want
more features, you should look at upstream.

It removes:
- growl notifications
- audio notifications
- settable time periods
- all UI outside of the menu bar

It adds:
- a small selection of preset time intervals
- notifications via Notification Center.
